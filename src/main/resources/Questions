1.create a service method called customer_registration() which will accept I am,  name, email, password and mobile number and store them inside Database.

Here Iam can be three different values( buyer,  owner, agent)

If Iam value is buyer then data will store in the table name customer_registration_buyer

If Iam value is owner then data will store in the table name customer_registration_owner

If Iam value is agent then data will store in the table name customer_registration_agent

2. Create a service method called customer_login() which will accept username (email) and password and verify customer provided login credentials with database, if username and password combination exists, then allow the customer to login to application.

Here make sure the customer can be anyone from buyer. ,owner and agents.we need to check and verify across all tables. Then confirm.

Also we need to send some indication from the method in return that the login customer is which type like agent, Owner or buyer.
